# Final-Project-in-CCS229-Intellegence-System

Give the python code for this project with the libraries and functionalities:
For your final project, you will develop an intelligent system using Python and a user interface framework like Streamlit. This system will utilize OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate creative text formats based on user prompts and choices. The project will showcase a multi-level prompting approach to guide the user towards a specific creative text output.

Project Requirements:

    Libraries:
        OpenAI API (https://openai.com/)
        Streamlit (or similar) for web interface (https://streamlit.io/)
    Functionalities:
        Multi-Level Prompting: The application should interact with the user through a series of prompts, with each level refining the creative direction. There should be at least two levels of prompts before reaching the final prompt.
        GPT-3 Integration: Leverage OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate creative text formats based on the user's prompts and choices.
        User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit or a similar platform to guide users through the prompting process and display the generated creative text.
